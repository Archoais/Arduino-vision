# Arduino-vision
A lightweight algorithm to enable object detection for Arduino projects.

The algoritm detects edges from a .bmp file or direct video feed and renders
a black and white image with edges highlighted in red, detected object highlighted
with a green square, and calculates a suitable picking point for a robot (blue square).
